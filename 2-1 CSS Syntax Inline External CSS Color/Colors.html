        <h4>CSS Syntax</h4>
        <p>A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.</p>
        <h1>{color:blue;font-size:12px;}</h1>
        <p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.</p>
        <p>The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.</p>
        <p>Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.</p>
        <p>Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</p>
        <h4>What does syntax mean in CSS?</h4>
     <p>In HTML and CSS, syntax is the order in which elements appear or are written, meaning the grammar and spelling of the language. Syntax rules are in place to ensure the languages are always written in a way that can be read or interpreted by a computer.</p>
