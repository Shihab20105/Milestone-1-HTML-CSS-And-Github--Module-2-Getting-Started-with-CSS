        <h4>What does style mean in CSS?</h4>
        A style is a set of formatting characteristics that are defined in a cascading style sheet (CSS) and define how to display HTML elements. You can apply styles to content in a web page, including text (individual characters or entire paragraphs), graphics, layers, tables, and even to the body of the entire web page.</p>

        <h4>When to use style in CSS?</h4>
        <h5>Internal CSS</h5>
        
        Internal or embedded CSS requires you to add a <b>style</b> tag in the <b>head</b>  section of your HTML document. This CSS style is an effective method of styling a single page. However, using this style for multiple pages is time-consuming as you need to put CSS rules on every page of your website.</p>
